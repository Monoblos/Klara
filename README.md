> Denn mit Klara wird alles klarer.

What is this?
-------------

Klara is a command-line tool for java, which will add informational output to your program at runtime.
This information includes for example variable values before conditions are checked, stating which branch was executed at if/else-if/else statements or counting loop iterations done.

Usage
-----

Execution using klara usually looks like this:  
	java Klara com.example.Test arg1 arg2

This would call the main-method of the class "com.example.Test" parsing the arguments "arg1" and "arg2".
